# Regular Expressions  - Make

## IP Address Validation
In this make task, you will write regular expressions to check if a given string represents an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or none of these. 
- IPv4 was the first publicly used Internet Protocol which used 4 byte addresses which permitted for 232 addresses. The typical format of an IPv4 address is A.B.C.D where A, B, C and D are Integers lying between 0 and 255 (both inclusive).
- IPv6, with 128 bits was developed to permit the expansion of the address space. To quote from the linked article: The 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each. Each group is written as 4 hexadecimal digits and the groups are separated by colons (:). The address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329 is an example of this representation. 

Use the list ```ipAddresses``` to test your regex. How many IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses are in the list?
