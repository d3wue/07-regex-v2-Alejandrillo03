# Regular Expressions  - Modify
In this unit you will practice writing your own regular expressions in Python. 

## Task 1
In the files ```task1.py```, you find a very simple URL checker. Expand the regular expression to allow the URL checker to capture:
1. different protocols (http, https)
2. more complex URLs (subdomains, paths)
3. multiple domains

In the file, you will find different examples that your URL checker should be able to capture.

## Task 2
In the file ```task2.py```, you will find a regular expression to check for names. Expand the regular expression to also capture Title Pre and Suffixes. 
In the file, you will find different examples that your name checker should be able to capture.
