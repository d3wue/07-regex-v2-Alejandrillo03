# Functions  - Predict and run
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about functions in Python. 

Look at the example code in the files ```task1.py``` - ```task4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!
